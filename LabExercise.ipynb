The text provided in the file [`encrypted01.bin`](./encryted01.bin) (click file to open in JupyterLab) has been encrypted by using an affine cipher. The affine cypher is a very simple type of monoalphabetic substitution cypher where each numerical character of the alphabet is encrypted using a mathematical function.

    "As each of the encrypted character values are independent we can use the GPU to decrypt them in parallel.
