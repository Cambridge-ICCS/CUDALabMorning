    "Exercise 1 requires that we de-cipher some encrypted text. The text provided in the file [`encrypted01.bin`](./encryted01.bin) (click file to open in JupyterLab) has been encrypted by using an affine cipher. The affine cypher is a very simple type of monoalphabetic substitution cypher where each numerical character of the alphabet is encrypted using a mathematical function. The encryption function is defined as;\n",

    "Where $A$ and $B$ are keys of the cypher, mod is the modulo operation and $A$ and $M$ are co-prime. For this exercise the value of $A$ is `15`, $B$ is `27` and $M$ is `128` (the size of the ASCII alphabet). The affine decryption function is defined as:\n",

    "Note: The $mod$ operation is not the same as the remainder operator (`%`) for negative numbers. A suitable $mod$ function (`modulo`) has been provided for the example. The provided function takes the form of `modulo(int a, int b)` where `a` in this case is everything left of the affine decryption functions $mod$ opertor and `b` is everything to the right of the $mod$ operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "As each of the encrypted character values are independent we can use the GPU to decrypt them in parallel. To do this we will launch a thread for each of the encrypted character values and use a kernel function to perform the decryption. Starting from the code provided in [`exercise01.cu`](./exercise01.cu) (click file to open and edit in JupyterLab), complete the following  tasks;\n"
